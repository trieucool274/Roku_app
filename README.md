# Assignment Description:
This project will span both semesters of the Authoring class. You will design and prototype the
functionality in the fall semester and build the app in the final Winter semester.
Part 1 will focus on the initial design and prototyping, as well as scaffolding and project setup.
PEASE NOTE - you are not required to build a finished project for Part 1. This is about
brainstorming, planning, research and development. Think about UX /UI; plan out and develop a
roadmap document. Think about weekly deliverables for both team members (or bi-weekly -
keep a regular schedule though). Consider your development stack, and component-based
architecture - what widgets will you need? How will they connect? What types of controls will
trigger functionality?
